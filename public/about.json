    "I'm a versatile software developer with a passion for creative problem-solving and collaboration.",
    "Before transitioning into engineering, I honed my project management skills as a marketing producer, where I successfully oversaw up to a dozen projects at a time. This experience taught me the importance of strategic planning, cross-functional teamwork, and fostering strong stakeholder relationships, all of which continue to inform my approach to software development.",
    "Currently, I work as a software developer at Karen Clark & Co., specializing in both frontend and backend development. My work includes enhancing intuitive React apps, maintaining a SQL database importer written in C# with a Windows Forms UI, and developing new functionality in ASP.NET APIs. I also upkeep a PHP-based CMS for the company website and helped build new, extensible geospatial lookup service written in C#.",
    "With a strong foundation in software development and a background in project management, I thrive in dynamic environments where cooperation, time management, and effective communication are key. I'm always excited to tackle challenging projects that push boundaries and deliver meaningful impact."
